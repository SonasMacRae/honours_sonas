# An investigation into solving the Travelling Salesman Problem using nature inspired techniques

This paper has two main sections, a literature review and a write up about an implementation of algorithms to solve the travelling salesman problem (TSP).
The focus of the paper was to compare nature inspired techniques against deterministic methods, looking into whether the time needed to run the stochastic algorithms pays off with better results over the deterministic methods, which require comparitavely less processing power.

An ant colony optimisation algorithm, an evolutionary algorithm, and a distrubuted evolutionary algorithm (also known as an island model) were implemented into a command line app which stored results and had the ability to display data on graphs, such as score over generations.
